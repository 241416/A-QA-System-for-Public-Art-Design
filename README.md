# A-QA-System-for-Public-Art-Design
we use RAG and Fine-tune to build a QA system for the field of Public Arts Design. This is our "Deep Learning and Neural Network" assignment.

 # data_build
 we use gpt-3.5-turbo and baituan-3-turbo to summarize our key points for evey papar and generate question-answer file to fine-tune LLM.
 the reason we choose RAG+Fine-tune is that we want both the arts knowledge increase of LLM and an external reliable knowledge base for its query
